## The Installer
The Melon Loader developers have provided an easy to use installer.\
You can download the installer from the [Melon Loader releases tab](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases). Make sure the version is at least `v0.4.1`.

Open up the installer and select the `demeo.exe` file in your install directory and press install.

## Getting an alpha build (optional)
Now that you have the base loader installed you may need to install the latest alpha build from the Melon Loader [Actions tab](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/actions).\
Click on the latest run and download the artifact labeled `MelonLoader.x64.CI`.\
Extract the zip so that `version.dll` is in the same folder as `demeo.exe`.

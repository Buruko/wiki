## MelonLoader's Demeo Specific Features
LavaGang, the MelonLoader developers, have been working directly with Resolution Games to add somewhat of an official modding api to Demeo.
All of these features are in the `Boardgame.ModdingAPI` namespace with the main feature being the mod menu which shows what mods you have installed.
